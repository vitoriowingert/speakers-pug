# Express + Pug Template Engine

In this project I used ExpressJS to serve my app, Pug Template Engine for the HTML work and SASS as a preprocessor, and I also used only basic JS (no libs or plugins)

## 2. Development requirements

* Replicate the web element exactly according to the design layout. 
* Make the layout adaptive for tablet and mobile devices. Adaptability is at your discretion.
* Browsersâ€™ support (latest versions): Google Chrome; Firefox; Safari; Edge; Opera.
* Develop a pop-up/modal window with a description of the speaker. 
  * By clicking on the photo of the speaker, the modal window should appear with a description of the specific speaker. Use any mock data (lorem ipsum).
  * The modal window should close by pressing the 'X' element or the `Esc` key.

## Note
* I've tried to do the best I can, even though I have no knowledge of Express or Pug!
